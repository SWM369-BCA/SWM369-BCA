### [* EDUCATION and EXPERIENCE *]

[My Mother after having 3 boys in 4 years desired a girl and 7 years later not even contraception could stop my entrance, unfortunately for my Mother I was not 
the little female bundle of joy but a 10 pound screamin front rower! School was never my thing even though maths and sciences came pretty easy to me, rugby from 6 and competition 
swimmming kept me off the streets till 16. 
I was 11 when my second eldest Brother, Ian, had been tragically killed riding pillion in a motorcycle accident and Richard my older Brother witnessed this traumatic event which as you can imagine
punished him internally until panceatic cancer took him 20 years after.
Two Private schools of Sydney couldn"t comprehend let alone deal with me so I ended up doing my H.S.C. at a N.S.W TAFE College in North Sydney with a desire to do engineering like my Father
but instead I was offered the opportunity to go overseas and play rugby in France, so as Saddam Hussien's armed forces in august 1990 invaded Kuwait I flew into Paris.  

Cooking for people is a passion of mine.Beautiful food, engaging characters, an equilibrium that allows engagement of ones vibrational energies to flow with love happiness and laughter!
Working in a commercial kitchen is a different story and when i wasn't on the rugby field it was a kitchen, somewhere in Sydney, you would find me.]
